I'm a full--stack web technology lead with a passion for new solutions, tempering rapid-release schedules with the performance and stability modern languages and libraries have to offer.  I am fluent in *Python*, *Javascript*, *Elm*, and *Elixir*, and proficient in *Haskell*. I've worked with *Google Compute*, *AWS*, *Docker*, and *Kubernetes*, and databases such as *Postgres* and *Neo4j*. I love crafting *ergonomic APIs* that keep developer productivity high.

In my spare time, I rock climb, read sci-fi, play guitar, and develop numerous open source projects.

    -- {Link|Why Elm?| url = https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/why-elm/9781491990728/} --- published by O'Reilly

        I demonstrate how Elm, a language for frontend web development, characterized by *no<>runtime<>errors* and an invincible--feeling *refactoring experience*, is not only a strong choice for your next project, but for developing mastery as an engineer.

    -- {Link|elm-ui|url = https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-ui}

        /What if you never had to write HTML//CSS again?/
        
        I built a bottom--up, typesafe, developer--friendly *replacement for HTML//CSS* that ensures a tiny change to your code *won't break your layout unexpectedly*.  Your time is more important than tracking down weird CSS issues.

    -- {Link|elm-markup| url=https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-markup}

        Build truly dynamic content with the ease and the safety of static types. A {Code|markdown} replacement with *built-in extensibility* and *intermixing of interactive elements*.

    -- {Link|elm-style-animation| url = https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-style-animation}

        The most prominent *pure--Elm animation library*.

    -- {Code|elm-animator} -- /not yet released/

        I developed a *powerful new approach* to animation which focuses on a central *timeline data structure* and takes animation in Elm to a *higher level*, but maintains *ease<>and<>expressiveness*.
