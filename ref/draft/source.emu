I am fluent in *Python*, *Javascript*, *Elm*, and *Elixir*, and proficient in *Haskell*. I've worked with *Google Compute*, *AWS*, *Docker*, and *Kubernetes* and am comfortable with Unix based systems, and databases such as *Postgres* and *Neo4j*.  I'm constantly learning new technology, but balance that desire with a firm grasp of shipping robust projects now.

I rock climb and design open source projects in my free time and have a passion for science fiction, board games, and creative collaboration.

    -- [Why Elm?](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/why-elm/9781491990728/) --- published by O'Reilly

        *Elm* is a potent language for frontend web development characterized by *no<>runtime errors*, *enforced semantic versioning on packages*, and a near unbreakable *refactoring experience*.  The biggest challenge for large projects is *maintainability*, which is hands-down Elm's strong suit compared to other solutions in the frontend realm.  This is why I wrote a book for O'Reilly on why Elm is an important technology.

    -- [`elm-ui`](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-ui) 

        A bottom-up replacement for HTML\\/CSS with the familiarity of styled-components, but the power of a *layout language that's designed for apps* as opposed to documents.  Compatible with *all major browsers* and has an active userbase.

    -- [`elm-markup`](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-markup)

        A markup language that is *made for interactive content*.  Languages like `markdown` are hard to integrate to highly interactive content.  This library is an extensible *markup language parser* which allows you to intermix interactive elements with your markup.

    -- [`elm-style-animation`](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-style-animation)

        Currently the most prominent *pure--elm animation library*.

    -- `elm-animator` -- /not yet released/

        Focusing on a central *timeline data structure* makes animation in Elm *easy<>and<>expressive* (something that has been very difficult in immutable langauges.)
